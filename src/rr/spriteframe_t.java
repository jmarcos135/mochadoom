/** Sprites are patches with a special naming convention
 * so they can be recognized by R_InitSprites.

 * x indicating the rotation, x = 0, 1-7.
 * The sprite and frame specified by a thing_t
 * is range checked at run time.
 * A sprite is a patch_t that is assumed to represent
 * a three dimensional object and may have multiple
 * rotations pre drawn.
 * Horizontal flipping is used to save space,
 * thus NNNNF2F5 defines a mirrored patch.
 * Some sprites will only have one picture used
 * for all views: NNNNF0
